This is Aero-ion a theme for GTK 2.x. It is an inverse Aqua-style theme, in
which the gas phase and the liquid phase have been switched.

The 'Aero-ion' version (versus plain 'Aero') is modified to be much more 
practical (background is plain instead of checked for most things, 
 and checkbuttons and radio options were improved to be both more legible
 and more sensible.). 

The most recent version of Aero-ion can be found at art.gnome.org


INSTALLATION
------------

Just unpack into your ~/.themes directory and use gconf-editor to switch
theme. 

Unfortunately Nautilus seems to disrespect Aero theme settings, when
using the icon view. This can be solved by creating a new background
color (color value is #37383F), and drag it onto the icon view pane.
Nautilus automagically switches the icon title color to white.

Create a new background color (from the Nautilus online help file):

To add a color to the colors that you can use on your screen components,
choose Edit-> Backgrounds and Emblems. Click on the Colors button, then
click on the Add New Color button. A color selector dialog is displayed.
Use the color wheel or the sliders to choose the color (enter #37383F
here). Click OK to add the new color to the Backgrounds and Emblems
dialog.
